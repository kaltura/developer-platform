# New Workflow
Use the text editor to write a description of what your workflow
will cover. You can use
[markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

To add the first step, click the  <i class="fa fa-plus"></i>  icon in the progress bar above.

If you want to see how your workflow looks, open the menu
<code><i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></code>
above the progress bar (next to the title) and click `Preview`.
To come back to the editor, click `Edit` in the same menu.

Once you're done, open the menu
above the progress bar and click `Save`. We'll open a pull request in
[kaltura/developer-platform](https://github.com/kaltura/developer-platform)
which adds the new workflow. It will go live shortly after being merged.

Once it's saved to GitHub, you can always come back to your workflow by clicking the
`Load` button in the same menu. You can get the URL for your saved workflow
by going to the pull request you generated, choosing the recipe's `readme.md`
file, and clicking 'Raw'.
